# CPM-Single-Board-Computer
CP/M 2.2 Single Board Computer

This project is a full working single board computer with the 8085 cpu that runs CP/M 2.2.

BIOS is compiled with ASMX 2.0 on my PC and written to EPROM or EEPROM with a BARLINO II programmer.

Bios contains code to format diskettes and to start creating disks with the CPM software by uploading the .HEX files one by one and save them
with the standard save command or with the H2C command
RAM disk is provided hardware but no bios code until now !
